# Coding challenge - Submission

## Pre-requisites

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (and npm) must be installed

## How to run

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Things that should change

- stop relying on the public Tailwindcss stylesheet
  - unused styles are removed leaving a smaller stylesheet
  - this is handled for us by using build tools that come with nextjs/emberjs/etc
